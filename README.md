# fvtt-FakeDice
FakeDice is based on a old module "[Fudge](https://github.com/troygoode/fvtt-fudge)". Since it is old module and have a period of time not update.

So I have do some research on how to make it perfect.

FakeDice can work on every mod and gameSystem. If they are still using the foundryVTT dice system.

You can easily learn how to use it. Just put ```>1``` or ```<=20``` something like that into target result. And click "Replace" button to Transform all the dice result to target result.

Now every dice you roll will meet the target result you want.

After get the result just click "Origin" to make it back to normal dice.
